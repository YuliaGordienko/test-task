## Task 1
### Revers Array

The Array's `reverse()` method has gone missing! Re-write it, quick-sharp!

When this method is called, it reverses the order of the items in the original array. Then it returns that same, original array. No new arrays should need to be created to pass this task.

```bash
const input = [1, 2, 3, 4];
input.reverse(); // == [4, 3, 2, 1]  // returned by .reverse()
input;           // == [4, 3, 2, 1]  // items reordered in the original array
```

Use best practices that you know.


const object1 = {
	a: 1,
	b: {
		h: 2
		b: 'string',
	},
};
const object2 = {
	a: 1,
	b: {
		h: 2
		b: 'string',
	},
};
yourFunction(object1, object2) // true
```

Use best practices that you know.
